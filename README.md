## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vanilla JS](https://www.javascript.com/)

### What I learned

With this project my layout skills were really tested, specially with the intro section for both mobile and desktop designs.

### Continued development

I want to keep improbing my layout skills, specially with harder designs. I also want to keep improving my JS skills, I feel like I'm not using it to its full potential, but I will use mostly vanilla Js when a framework it's not really necessary.
